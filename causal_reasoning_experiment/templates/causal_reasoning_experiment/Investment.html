    <p>In this experiment, you take on the role of a CEO of a hypothetical company that aims to develop new products by investing in research and development. For each newly developed product, you will receive a bonus of {{ reward_to_show }} points. You can invest a maximum of 100 points.

        <p>Your task is to decide how much you want to invest in research and development. Investing costs points. Investing more always makes developing a new product more likely. However, the positive effect of investments in research and development decreases the more you invest, i.e. it is quite more likely to develop a new product when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points. </p>

        <p>You will make {{ Constants.num_rounds}} decisions in total, and you can use the outcome of the previous decisions to help you figure out the optimal level of investment. Note that developing a new product always includes chance: the same level of investment will often lead to different outcomes. Lastly, after each round the researchers try to develop a completely different product. Thus, whether a new product is developed does not depend on how much you invested in previous periods.</p>

    <p>  Once the experiment is over your bonus payment will be 1$ per {{ points_per_dollar }} points. </p>
