<p>In this experiment, you take on the role of a CEO of a hypothetical company that aims to develop new products by investing in research and development. For each newly developed product, you will receive a bonus of {{ reward_to_show }} points. You can invest a maximum of 100 points.

    {% if player.treatment == 1 %}
    <p>Your task is to decide how much you want to invest in research and development. Investing costs points. The probability for creating a successful product depends on whether your research team was able to get a new patent out of the research activity and on the success of your competitor. Getting a patent and having an unsuccessful competitor makes developing a successful product more likely. Investing more always makes getting a new patent more likely. However, the positive effect of investments in research and development decreases the more you invest, i.e. it is quite more likely to get a new patent when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points. The success of your competitor cannot be affected by your investment decisions.</p>

    <p>You will make {{ num_rounds }} decisions in total, and you can use the outcome of the previous decisions to help you figure out the optimal level of investment. Note that developing a new product always includes chance: the same level of investment will often lead to different outcomes. Lastly, after each round the researchers try to develop a completely different product. Thus, whether a new product is developed does not depend on how much you invested in previous periods.</p>

<p>  Once the experiment is over your bonus payment will be $1 per {{ points_per_dollar }} points. If you end up with a negative score, your bonus payment will be $0. </p>
</div>

<p> Before you can start the experiment you must complete a short quiz. You need to get all the questions correct before you can continue. You have {{Constants.num_rounds}} tries in total, if you fail them all you will be disqualified from the experiment.</p>

<p> Try {{player.round_number}}/{{Constants.num_rounds}} of the quiz.</p>

{% if player.round_number > 1 %}
<p style="color: red; font-weight:bold;"> At least one of your answers was incorrect, read the instructions and try again. </p>
