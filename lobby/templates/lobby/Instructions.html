<div id="instructions">
<p>In this experiment, your goal is to develop new products by investing in research and development. For each newly developed product, you will receive a bonus of {{ reward_to_show }} points. Investing costs points. The effect of investing is decreasing the more you invest <!-- here we could do the following to decrease the length of the instructions: a dropdown "click here for more information/example" or something like that, which gives the example, depending on treatment:
{% if player.treatment <= 2 %}
    <p>It is quite more likely to get a new patent when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points.
    </p>
    {% endif %}
{% if player.treatment == 3 %}
    <p>It is quite more likely to develop a new product when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points.       </p>
    {% endif %}
-->. 

    {% if player.treatment == 1 %}
    <p>The probability for creating a successful product depends on whether your research team was able to get a new patent out of the research activity and on the success of your competitor.</p>
    {% endif %}

    {% if player.treatment == 2 %}
    <p>The probability for creating a successful product depends on whether the research team was able to get a new patent out of the research activity.</p>
    {% endif %}

 <!--{% if player.treatment == 3 %}
    <p></p>
    {% endif %}-->   

    <p>You will make {{ num_rounds }} decisions in total. Whether a new product is developed does not depend on how much you invested in previous periods.</p>

<p>  Once the experiment is over your bonus payment will be $1 per {{ points_per_dollar }} points. If you end up with a negative score, your bonus payment will be $0. </p>
</div>

<p> Before you can start the experiment you must pass a short quiz. You have {{Constants.num_rounds}} tries in total, if you fail them all you will be disqualified from the experiment.</p>

<p> Try {{player.round_number}}/{{Constants.num_rounds}} of the quiz.</p>

{% if player.round_number > 1 %}
<p style="color: red; font-weight:bold;"> At least one of your answers was incorrect, read the instructions and try again. </p>
{% endif %}

 <!--maybe we can also decrease the number of quiz questions. Is it essential for them to understand the answers for 1 and 2? they will learn them in like 5 rounds max.--> 

{% formfield player.q1 label="If you invest fifty points and a new product is successfully developed, by how many points do your total points increase?" %}
{% formfield player.q2 label="If you invest thirty points, and no new prodcut is developed, by how many points do your total points decrease?" %}
{% formfield player.q3 label="How many investment decisions will you make in total?" %}
{% formfield player.q4 label="Will a decision you make in one period directly affect future periods in any way?" %}
{% formfield player.q5 label="If you earn a total of 5000 points, what will be your bonus payment in $?" %}
