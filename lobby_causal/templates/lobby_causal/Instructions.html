<p> In this  experiment you will face a number of problems that looks like the one below</p>
<!-- {% if player.treatment <= 2 %}
    <p>It is quite more likely to get a new patent when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points.
    </p>
    {% endif %}
{% if player.treatment == 3 %}
    <p>It is quite more likely to develop a new product when you invest 20 instead of 10 points, but only a little more likely when you invest 90 instead of 80 points.       </p>

<!--

    <p>The probability for creating a successful product depends on whether your research team was able to get a new patent out of the research activity and on the success of your competitor.</p>

<p>Each circle can be turned on or off (turn green or red, respectively). You can affect whether one of the circles is turned on by spending activation points. The percentage in the circle represents the probability of the circle turning on based on the number of points you plan to invest. If the final circle is turned on, you receive a reward as indicated in the final circle (in this example, 200 points). If it is not turned on you will get 0 points. The circles are connected by arrows that represent causal relationships. This means, that there is a connection between whether the circle is turned on and the probability of whether the circle at the tip of the arrow is turned on. </p>

<p>For each problem you will make {{ num_rounds }} decisions in total. You are not provided with all the information necessary to make the optimal investment at the outset, but since you make the same decision many times you can figure out what a good level of investment is. After each decision you will se the results presented in the following way, where green means that variable was activated and red that it was not.</p>

<div class='canvas' id="root-activated-example">

<p>
So in this example we see the invested points gave a 33% probabilty of turning on the circle. We also see that three circles ended up being turned on. The goal variable is turned on so the payoff was 200.</p>

<p>Once the experiment is over your bonus payment will be $1 per {{ points_per_dollar }} points. If you end up with a negative score, your bonus payment will be $0. </p>

<hr/>

<p> Before you can start the experiment you must pass a short quiz. You have {{Constants.num_rounds}} tries in total, if you fail them all you will be disqualified from the experiment.</p>

<p> Try {{player.round_number}}/{{Constants.num_rounds}} of the quiz.</p>

{% if player.round_number > 1 %}
<p style="color: red; font-weight:bold;"> At least one of your answers was incorrect, read the instructions and try again. </p>
{% endif %}

 <!--maybe we can also decrease the number of quiz questions. Is it essential for them to understand the answers for 1 and 2? they will learn them in like 5 rounds max.-->

{% formfield player.q1 label="Consider the example above. If you invest fifty points and the final circle is turned on, how much do your total points increase?" %}
{% formfield player.q2 label="With the same example, if you invest thirty points, and the final circle is turned off, by how many points do your total points decrease?" %}
{% formfield player.q3 label="How many investment decisions will you make for each problem?" %}
{% formfield player.q4 label="Will a decision you make in one period directly affect future periods in any way?" %}
{% formfield player.q5 label="If you earn a total of 5000 points, what will be your bonus payment in $?" %}
